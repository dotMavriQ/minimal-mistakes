## TODO @Dotmavriq.Life

* Logo for the header.

* Improve front end for CV
* Links page with materializecss-cards, bigger project
* Projects, same as Links but with the single cards link to blogposts for all of my projects.
* Guides, a page acting as the startpage but consisting of blogposts with the category Guides, use template from minimal-mistakes.
* Recipes, same as Guides but with a custom HTML that is of importance.
* Review, Cards, a unified model that can be slightly altered for me to review Books, Beer, Movies, Speeches, Code et.c.
* Make that gruvbox pop more
