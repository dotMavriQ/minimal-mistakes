I woke up having barely had any sleep and was met by my panic alarm, I quickly stuff some Snus under my lip, wash my face, my armpits, freshen up and head to work.

It was an ok day at a pretty good pace, I got stuff done but I did end up leaving work feeling unfulfilled which I hate.
Some days I'm a man that sees the world as a set of problems in dire need of solutions, and when my quota of solutions don't equate the problems I become a cranky little boy that has to swallow his pride and relax with a podcast and some food.

I put on the episode from the Jordan B. Petersson Podcast where he's in a conversation with Camille Paglia on the future of society and the dangers of postmodernism, I had already seen and thus heard the video version of it but figured it would be good enough to make due for my walk home from work. Having showed up a couple of minutes late it only felt right to leave work giving 30-40 minutes extra and also accompanying my fellow programming buddy as he had a crack at some backend/PHP-related issues.

The episode was really long and became a nice way to just procrastinate cooking and adulting.

I live in an area more or less dedicated to facilitating immigrants, I am one out of 2 Swedish inhabitants.
I really like it here and the experience has been really positive, the municipality that arranged for these module flat solutions have been really serviceminded and kind.[Except for a couple of incidents in the laundry room](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Un_b8wmJOBUVZROUVIcElXOEU) I can honestly say that I have no complaints and I'm willing to even top that off with a claim that I'd rather live here than in the city because with my experience in living in flats I have yet to hear a single drill, hammer, bass booming speaker, argument, car noises..not anything, I could hear the kids play outside when it was sunny but for the most part that was just really pleasant and gave my home a vibrant feel to it, I'm glad the kids around here are happy and engaged in play.

## Yeah, it's not like living any place else.

 I had a neighbour who I just found out isn't living here anymore that knocked on my door on my sixth day living here to try to help me help him buy a used car on Blocket, it was odd but it left me feeling good and I did have my lights on and he looked ashamed that he had asked that late but he probably saw it as a really good deal and there was probably some degrees of desperation involved. He later invited me over and gave me a beer in exchange for me looking at a Swedish car insurance.

  I tried to explain to him that I don't have a car nor do I have insurance myself and that bureaucracy can be tough in Sweden but it didn't really get through so I called the municipality the day after and got in contact with a dude that works for a local insurance firm that knew arabic and put the number next to an image of a phone and a clock to display what times they could call him and then I put that note on my neighbours door, I was stressing to the store one day when he rushed to open his door just to thank me with a bright smile on his face, that kind of stuff is enough to kill any negativity in your life for a good couple of days.

Back to today, I had just finished that episode and finally stopped being a cranky snot-nosed boy ready to make some really uninspired carbonara for the umpteenth time since I moved out. I hear some knocks on my door and I'm going to be honest, I'm willing to be a neighbour, a good one even, but I don't care if you're Swedish, of other origin, the Queen, the Pope or Rihanna; I am NOT opening my door to someone unannounced at night unless it is a complete emergency when I'm undressed like a bachelor preparing my late night grub.

The knocking becomes ever more intense and paralell to this I also hear frantic running and knocking on the the other neighbours doors, the talking outside intensifies, my brain fires "It's a fire isn't it?".

I open the door and there's a younger girl, a boy and an older lady telling me that there is smoke emitting from the building, they look clearly worried and in need of help. I also see other people leaving their flats to investigate or warn other neighbours. I want to keep my wits about me as the adrenaline strikes so I tell the young man that I'll call the fire department, as I do that I do actually see emissions of smoke and they did not make that smell up. It clearly did smell like burning plastic, let's just say my spidey-sense was tingling at this point.

The kind lady on the line took me through steps as I tried to make sense of where the smoke was coming from, I couldn't give her a clear answer so I just told her what my neighbours said and that I too have seen the smoke and sensed the smell.

At first a regular duty car shows up, I believe one fireman in civil clothing ran all the way there just to check.
And then comes a complete firetruck with fully dressed and ready firemen, as I turn around I notice that my neighbours have conveniently left me there to discuss things with the firemen, and that the smoke isn't really that present anymore.... .... .... .....

The Captain did sense a smoke emitting from my closest neighbours flat, but the ventilation could also belong to me, I ask some questions.. they look bothered which is understandable as they clearly can't see a source of smoke.

I told them all I could and one man ensured me that I did the right thing.

And after the captain himself went into my punk rock 1 room appartment with my disgusting heap of unwashed dishes he scoffs and gently tells me that they can't see any fire hazard in the building.

And no sign of the neighbours afterwards either.

It took some time for me to calm down, I didn't know if I was angry or scared or anything.. just riled up, full of adrenaline.

I skyped Margarida and she did a really good job of calming me down, and then I sat down to write this.

I don't think my neighbours necessarily overreacted, and I do feel genuinely respected knowing that they went out of their way to see if I was in my flat. One possible theory is that the flats are very small and thus warm air mixed with cooking fumes could be the culprit that solicited this reaction out of them, and you know what? When I was there with them I thought that it really did burn somewhere too.

In a freak case of synchronicity, it so happens that my fire alarm beeped last night to the point of having to pull it's batteries out, and I haven't changed it yet. But I will now.

This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No Alarms and No Surprises
