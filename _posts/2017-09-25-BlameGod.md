I was met with a pleasant surprise when I went to the mailbox this morning.

I finally got my hands on the Blame God debut on cassette.

Blame God is a complete beast of an up and coming band from New York.
Mark Valentino has been an internet friend of mine for many years and it's so good to finally hear that his hard work is paying off.

They play a brooding take on the type of death metal that grew out of the Stockholm scene in Sweden, and the guitars are oozing with HM-2 goodness..but there's all types of goodness from other parts of the current extreme metal and hardcore scene.

If you are a fan of bands like Converge, Rotten Sound and Nails this is definitely something for you! 

My favourite tracks on this release are the last two songs, Jarhead and Blame God.

>Keep an eye out for these guys, they've gotten shoutouts from Trevor from Black Dahlia Murder as well as Nails.
