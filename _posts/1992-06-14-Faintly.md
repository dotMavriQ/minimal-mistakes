<pre>
Faintly I'll go

To take this head on

Soon I'll come around
Lost and never found
Waiting for my words
Seen but never heard
Buried underground
But I'll keep coming

Wipe those tears off

And make your heart proud

Soon I'll come around
Lost and never found
Waiting for my words
Seen but never heard
Buried underground

But I'll keep coming
