Thoughtmavriq is a series I will release where I speak my mind as I reflect what is happening in the world. The intent is to learn and to practise free speech and thusly free thought as I hopefully expand the minds of my readers in pursuing expanding my own. 

I have a sickening amount of things I want to talk on immediately. The Political dichotomy of Left and Right and my own personal development politically and ideologically, contemporary questions posed by public intellectuals as well as critical looks at why we act like the way we do in modern society. 

Sometimes this series will be more open and sometimes it will be downright intellectually perverted and deal with seemingly very niche topics, whatever I say goes. If you don't like it you can always practise your freedom not to engage in any degree you see fit. 

My road in Leftism and what I've learned, language and its importance, Trump(WikiLeaks), Feminism, Durkheim to Nietzsche and forward,  Postmodernism, Peterson and Žižek. 
Political Compass and such psychometry and more.
