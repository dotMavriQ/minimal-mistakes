Woke up ~09:00 in the morning and got as ready as I could get before my dear mother picked me up in the Toyota. 

We had agreed that she could drive me to Skövde Käkkirurgiska because she had to tend to my grandmother who lives in Skara later anyway. 

Waiting took a while, glad I had my mother there because dumb as I am I forgot to bring my ID, so she vouched for me. 

After half an hour of waiting ( Landsting these days ).. I was greeted met with a woman who took me through the process and if I would want to do the surgery.. I agreed hahah.. I mean, what REAL choice do I have? 

I got A LOT of anaesthesia, and she had an incredible technique when she applied it too like hahaha.. I was impressed. She put a finger at the end of my jawline and everything got applied without any pain of discomfort at all, freakishly competent I must say.

While the 'something-caine' sets in I changed clothes, set my hair in a net.. It was pretty reminiscent of last time I did it. 

I got help finding the surgery room and then they started opening up a wound in order to remove the tooth.

They said something about changing a bag.. possibly a collection bag for blood or just some saline. 

After I while I started to get quite dizzy and after a break to change some equipment the had drilled into the tooth, pryed it open, removed the parts and finally cleaned and sealed the wound. 

I thanked them for good care and met with my mother. 

We stayed at my grandmother's for a while, I stayed in my grandmother's bedroom while they had some meeting with care services. I listened to Beethoven and almost fell asleep. 

We quickly swung by Ica Munken before heading home, I bought two RisiFrutti Hallon XL and then my absolute favorite: Froosh. 

When my mother finally dropped my off at my flat I was in good spirits to have breakfast.. and boy was I wrong. 

I took the banana coconut Froosh. 
It tastes like heaven usually, but it also contains Pineapple.. and pineapple is actually slightly poisonous at least topically... And boy did I feel it.. the smallest swig you could imagine reached the wound in my mouth and it felt like throwing hot acid on a gaping wound...inside your mouth. 

After a solid 15 minutes of groaning and winceing from the pain I caused to myself I amped up all my painkillers, effectively leaving me on 2grams of Alvedon (Paracetamol) and 400mg of Ibuprophene. 

I decided to watch Monty Pythons Life of Brian, when the meds kicked in I ended up sleeping for 3-4 hours. 

My parents saved the day yet again by riding by my place and dropping food because in waking I felt so weak I feared fainting should I walk to a store, and stupid as I am I didn't do any sort of prep in regards to food for this. 

I call Margarida really late and after having talked to her I was in better spirits and finally made a really creamy, light-on-the-spices Risoni-Risotto with everything in it very finely chopped. 

I ate a absurdly big portion by eating most of it, falling asleep for an hour, waking up to hearing Margarida still on the phone sleeping silently.. I finished the Risotto and had water and returned to sleep.
