Not sure if pollen allergies or just generally fatigued but I've been wandering today like somewhat of a zombie, or.. a contempt zombie in pain?..something like that.

One thing is for certain though, it is REALLY hot outside, bringing both the good and the bad aspects of that.

I saw an ad for Mindly, some sort of app for people with mental health issues. I saw that they their Google App Store information was flawed and had them fix it, good deed of the day: **cleared!**


My garden seems to be doing well... that's good, I like that. Still haven't had a single strawberry though.. might be the birds..might be the neighbours kids but I'll keep it light with the Alex Jones accusations, it's just strawberries. 

My parents had me over for dinner and after a couple of days of toothache it sure feels good to finally be able to eat solid food again. 
I was served a burger on sour dough bread baked by my father with delicious coleslaw.
