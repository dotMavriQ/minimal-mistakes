* **Rhubarb** seems alive and well
* Holy shiz I can't believe the Portuguese **Butternut** I planted with seeds salvaged from one I bought in a supermarket is growing and doing well.
* **Red Basil** is doing good.
* **Chives** seem to be a bit rough, should tend to it more.
* **Thyme** is nice and going strong.
* Well hello there **Sallad**! 
* **Radishes** galore! 
* **Strawberry plants** are alive, no sign of strawberries though..
* My **Penis Chili**-plant is growing, no ehrm.. fruits on it yet though.
* **Ramson** is hanging in there..I guess?

yeah.. I've been a bit lazy with it lately, I'll make sure to shape it up soon enough though.
