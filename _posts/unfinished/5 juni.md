I woke up really late today.

I have been feeling a bit fatigued lately and I'm not sure why.. could anything from experiencing the dip( as in knowing what I could do to clear my head of obligations, where to acquire the knowledge I need ) to pollen allergies acting out. 

One thing is for sure: it's hot outside ALL the time, bringing the good and the bad aspects of that. 

My garden seems to be doing well. 

Had burgers with my parents.
