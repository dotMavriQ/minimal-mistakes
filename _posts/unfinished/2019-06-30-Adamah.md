I spent the saturday by going to Skara with Philip on a little roadtrip looking for things for [MakerSpace](http://lidmake.se).

We didn't really find lots of stuff that we could afford to donate to the MakerSpace at this time, or things that we experienced would bring that much active contribution to the way things are right now.. but I found a thermos that says Primus, that's always something!

On our way back we went into a second hand and saw this unfortunately sold but amazing construction of the old train bridge with matching electronic train, rails and all.

It came with a guide drawn by hand and everything, absolutely amazing stuff!

I bought a beer *or two* and we sat down to see Adamah live.


We ended up sitting on a bench next to some kind rather drunk men who seemingly drink with frequency, they weren't all too bothersome though. 



The Adamah set was really nice, I got a got chance to yell Freebird and so I did.

They played mostly new material which left me hungry to hear recorded versions of what they showcased, because that was some REALLY good stuff. I'm proud of them! 

All in all a really good set. 
My only complaint was a severe lack of Heretics of The Dawning Star, that song rules guys, you should've kept it in the set!

After that we went to Phils, had a baguette, almost passed out from the heat.. It's way too warm even for a Swedish summer, ugh.

Oh well, I think I'll manage. 

Over and out
